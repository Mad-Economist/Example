## MATLAB (French)

This directory contains tutorials on how to use MATLAB to accomplish common tasks in economics. I developed those scripts to teach a refresher on computer programming for new master's and PhD students for the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQÀM). Note that this directory nonetheless contains useful functions in *20_tools* such as make_latex -- a fairly flexible function to export tables in TEX format.

Sub-directory *00_prog* contains an introduction script and three scripts each covering a different type of task: 

1. Run OLS regressions and export results in summary tables in TEX format. Note that we use simulated data for convenience;
2. Comparing forecasting models in a pseudo-out-of-sample horse race;
3. Confirming some theoretical results in econometrics through Monte Carlo simulations.

If you prefer, I also offer the *exact same* problems in R in the directory R-Fr.
