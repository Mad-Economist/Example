## R (French)

This directory contains tutorials on how to use R to accomplish common tasks in economics. I developed those scripts to teach a refresher on computer programming for new master's and PhD students for the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQÀM).

Sub-directory *00_prog* contains an introduction script and three scripts each covering a different type of task: 

1. Run OLS regressions and export results in summary tables in TEX format. Note that we use simulated data for convenience;
2. Comparing forecasting models in a pseudo-out-of-sample horse race;
3. Confirming some theoretical results in econometrics through Monte Carlo simulations.

If you prefer, I also offer the *exact same* problems in MATLAB in the directory MATLAB-Fr.
