## LATEX (FRENCH)

This directory contains a short primer on how to start using LaTeX. Instructions are provided in French and may be dated as I wrote this alongside Manuel Paquette-Dupuis to help other students getting started with LaTeX back when I was completing my master's degree.

It has since been used as part of a refresher course on computer programming for new master's and PhD students for the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQÀM).
